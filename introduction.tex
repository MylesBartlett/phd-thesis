\noindent It is common knowledge that every good story should have a beginning, a middle, and an
end; for if a story had not those things it could scarcely be called a story at all, at most it
would be a nonsense one and nonsense should only be abided when founded on good sense.
%
This is where this thesis begins, a thesis that hopefully satisfies some of the reader's
sensibilities regarding what makes a good story; at the very least I hope it bears a scintilla of
sense, or perhaps even some estimate of erudition.
%
When I say \emph{story} I mean not, of course, to say that the contents is in any way
fictitious, counterfeit or embellished; as a story, this is a work of chapters and
bridging those chapters is evolution, both academically and personally.
%
For a story to \emph{become} -- to tell itself or let itself be told -- it must grow, by nature, by
contrivance, by necessity; stories reflect life and life is a process of growth, of betterment --
where each step moves us further along on a journey (not on a `chequerboard of nights and days', as
Khayyam so poetically but cynically scribed
%
\footnote{
    \emph{
        %
        “Tis all a Chequerboard of nights and days //
        %
        Where Destiny with men for Pieces plays: //
        %
        Hither and thither moves, and mates,and slays, //
        %
        And one by one back in the closet lays.”
        %
    }
}

), one without a destination, but a journey one should
never yield on regardless of the times one stumbles.
%
I would also call this thesis a \emph{story} for the simple reason that -- having childish
tendencies -- I am fond of stories and I should naturally like to like a work born from my hand and
essentia -- there are perhaps elements I should think less fondly of but might imagine (in the
style of some dualistic tale) as the shadow that makes the light -- the nobler qualities -- burn
all the brighter.

\section{On themes and living chairs}
%
Every story has a theme, even if that theme is no theme at all, and whether it be conscious or
otherwise: an unbroken thread, the warp and weft, that weaves all into one.
%
This story is no exception; its theme is not one of valour, of defiance in the face of impossible
odds, or of taking the next step when the path ahead is fogged and the path behind beset with
demons -- indeed, the theme is nothing so inspiriting or ennobling -- that has the power to rouse
our best, eudaimonic selves -- but it bears its own importance -- not to the human condition but
the autonomous one -- nevertheless.

%
This is a Machine Learning (ML) thesis and the themes are suitably related to ML; if there
is one central theme that unites all themes across all chapters, it is the dialectical tension
between the \emph{statistical} nature of ML and the \emph{causal} nature of reality -- to mistake
the notion of \emph{correlation} -- born from the former -- with the notion of \emph{causation} is
a great fallacy (\emph{cum hoc ergo propter hoc}), as every new Statistics student learns before
most else.
%
That is to say, if two events, \(X\) and \(Y\), routinely co{\"o}ccur, with the former preceding
the latter, they are correlated, in that one can use the occurrence of \(X\) to predict the
occurrence of \(Y\) at an above-chance rate -- such is the indispensable utility of statistics, as
the quantification of \emph{patterns} (and ML is but sophisticated \emph{pattern recognition}) --
but one cannot reasonably extend this deduction that `\(X\) \emph{predicts} \(Y\)' to the much
deeper one, `\(X\) \emph{causes} \(Y\)' without employing interventions with the view to eliminate
confounding factors, i.e. factors causing both (and thereby correlating) \(X\) and \(Y\).
%
I should emphasise -- to stem right away any misconceptions about what this thesis is or aspires to
be -- that despite their being rooted in it, the themes of this thesis are not of causality itself,
by which I mean that, while I may use the calculus of causality to characterise and interconnect
phenomena, I never venture to solve the formidable problem of causal discovery head on, only those
problems emanating from it, representing the aforementioned tension.
%
% I shall now explain precisely what I mean by all this.

The simplest explanations are usually the best ones, and by \emph{best} I mean \emph{true} (or
approximately so) when it comes to \emph{reality} -- indeed, such was the consummate genius of
Newtonian, Einsteinian and Darwinian theories to collect myriad related-but-seemingly-distinct
phenomena, within unified models of startling (relatively) simplicity.
%
However, what is simplest in a statistical sense, with respect to a finite representation of
reality -- a \emph{dataset} -- does not always -- and often does not -- align with what is simplest
in the general sense that we can presume \emph{true}.
%
Modern physics frames the universe in terms of \emph{symmetries}, in terms of what changes and what
does not change subject to a particular action or group of actions or \emph{interventions} --
\emph{variances} and \emph{invariances} -- and this same notion, one of \emph{modularity of
subsystems}, is naturally expressible under a causal (and group-theoretic) framework.
%
Through this lens, the \emph{best} model is the one that completely accounts for all observations
as a function of the fewest variables -- one that is maximally invariant or modular.
%
This thesis is not a story of learning a true, causally-complete, world model -- for that would be
too lofty a goal -- however, the notion of invariance -- to specific concepts inducing specific
sets (open or closed) of transformations -- is at the heart of all problems broached -- each on its
own quite humble.
