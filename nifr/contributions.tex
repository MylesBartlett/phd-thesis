        T. Kehrenberg conceived of the idea of using an \acf{INN} combined with a representative
        set to learn an invariant representation in the face of spurious correlations, ran many of
        the experiments -- especially so in the initial stages -- and wrote much of the original
        text and code.

        I wrote a significant part of the code (being responsible for several refactorings as part
        of the debugging process), the much of the text, helped crystallise the initial idea, ran
        many of the experiments, aided in experimental analysis, and developed much of the
        bag-of-tricks found necessary train the \ac{INN} stably within the adversarial framework
        (grappling with the issues later elucidated by \cite{behrmann2021understanding}).

        O. Thomas aided in writing the code, in running the experiments, partook in discussion and
        analysis of results, helped writing and formatting the paper, and served as an unwavering
        source of optimism.

        N. Quadrianto supervised the project, providing feedback on current progress and iterations
        of the paper and advising which directions to pursue.
