        \textbf{T. Kehrenberg} conceived of the idea of using an INN combined with a
        representative set to learn an invariant representation in the face of spurious
        correlations, ran many of the experiments -- especially so in the initial stages -- and
        wrote much of the original text and code.

        \textbf{I} wrote a significant part of the code (being responsible for several refactorings
        as part of the debugging process), the much of the text, helped crystallise the initial
        idea, ran many of the experiments, aided in experimental analysis, and developed much of
        the technical tricks needed to train the INN stably within the adversarial framework
        (grappling with the issues later elucidated by \cite{behrmann2021understanding}).

        \textbf{O. Thomas} aided in writing the code, in running the experiments, partook in
        discussion and analysis of results, helped writing and formatting the paper, and served as
        an unwavering source of optimism.

        \textbf{N. Quadrianto} supervised the project, providing feedback on current progress and
        iterations of the paper and advising which directions to pursue.
