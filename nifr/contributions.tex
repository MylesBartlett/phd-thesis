    \item I developed a large part of the tricks needed for training the \ac{INN} successfully. I
        wrote a significant part of the code, and of the text.

    \item T. Kehrenberg conceived the idea of using an \acf{INN} and a representative set to learn
        an invariant representation. He wrote a large part of the code, and ran about half the
        experiments. He wrote a significant part of the text.

    \item O. Thomas helped with writing the code and with running the experiments.

    \item N. Quadrianto gave feedback on the progress and suggested directions to explore.
