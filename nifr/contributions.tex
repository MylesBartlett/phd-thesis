        \textbf{T. Kehrenberg} conceived of the idea of using an \ac{INN} combined with a
        representative set to learn an invariant representation in the face of spurious
        correlations, ran many of the experiments -- especially so in the initial stages -- and
        wrote much of the original text and code.

        \textbf{I} developed a significant part of the initial codebase and was later singularly
        responsible for several refactorings as part of the debugging and refinement process
        following the paper's first submission.
        %
        Beyond the code, I wrote the preponderance (with particular emphasis on the introduction
        and methodology) of the published text, helped to crystallise the initial idea and conduct
        a preliminary literature review, ran and monitored many of the experiments, and aided in
        experimental analysis, both qualitative and quantitative in nature.
        %
        Furthermore, I was responsible for introducing many of the tricks ultimately required to
        train the \ac{INN} stably issues later elucidated fully by
        \citealp{behrmann2021understanding}, though which we identified empirically early on) --
        the trick described in \S\ref{sec:those-darn-coupling-layers} most crucially -- in the
        adversarial regime and mitigate cyclic dynamics arising therefrom -- namely, stochastic
        ensembling and latent-space regularisation.

        \textbf{O. Thomas} aided in writing the code, in running the experiments, partook in
        discussion and analysis of results, helped writing and formatting the paper, and served as
        an unwavering source of optimism.

        \textbf{N. Quadrianto} supervised the project, providing feedback on current progress and
        iterations of the paper and advising which directions to pursue.
