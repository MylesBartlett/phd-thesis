\section{Some notes on notation}\label{sec:notation}
% ********************************************************************************
To simplify exposition, we will abuse notation throughout this chapter by allowing functions of the
form \(f: X \to Y \) to accept random and observed variables interchangeably; we assume that the
derived function classes are Borel Measurable (a trivial precondition in practice) and as such that
a function of a random variable is also a random variable. \(f\) to operate on random variables
\(X\).
% %
Thus, pedantically speaking, \( f(X) \) should be read as shorthand for \( f \circ X(\omega) \),
for some event \( \omega \) drawn from sample space, \( \Omega \), while \( f(x) \) should be read
in the standard fashion, with deterministic inputs and outputs.
