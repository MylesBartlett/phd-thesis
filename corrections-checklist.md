- All typographic and notational errors highlighted by the internal and external examiners have
  been amended.

- (pp.6,7) Footnotes with references to the publications underpinning Chapters 3 and 5 have been added to
  the chapter summaries at the end of the Introduction.

- (p.51) Fig. 3.1 has been relocated to a point adjacent to the in-text first reference to it.
  The caption has been greatly expanded, now addressing the involvement of null-sampling during
  training (i.e. none), this being a major point of confusion raised by the external examiner
  during the viva.

- (p.70) Personal contributions to Chapter 3 have been elaborated on.

- (p.83) The use of the mean of the projected representations as queries in the bag-wise aggregation
  function has been clarified in the main text. A note on the instance-wise and bag-wise objectives
  having theoretically- but not empirically-equivalent solutions (as adverted to by the external
  examiner) has been added.

  (p.119) The caption of Fig. 5.1 has been greatly expanded to now contain summaries of the two
  calipers and explanation of the red crosses (denoting exclusion from the candidate pool) added
  over the course of the pipeline. Readers in search of more details regarding the calipers and
  their motivation are referred to the RealPatch paper introducing them.

  (p.54) A reference to the Appendix providing (preliminary) empirical evidence of the hypothesis
  of increased OOD-robustness has been included here (together with some rephrasing).
