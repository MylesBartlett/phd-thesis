    \textbf{T. Kehrenberg} conceived of the initial idea of overcoming the limitation of the
    partially-annotated representative set in Chapter 3 through the use of distribution matching,
    wrote much of the original implementation and text, and was the primary experiment-runner
    during the nascent distribution-matching stage of the project.
    %
    Later in the project, he notably worked to establish theoretical guarantees for the
    support-matching method and a more rigorous formulism of the problem setup, while also
    continuing to aid with experiment-running and paper-writing (both to a reduced, but still
    significant, degree).
    %
  \item 
    %
    \textbf{I} proposed converting the problem of distribution-matching, proposed by T. Kehrenberg,
    into one of support-matching by means of source-balanced bags and a set-discriminator, a
    necessary element for achieving the desired goal of subgroup-invariance while preserving
    variance to the target.
    %
    On the practical front, while much of the original codebase was written by T. Kehrenberg, the
    lion's share of the (several-times) rewritten and extended (additional datasets, baselines,
    discriminator methods, etc.) one was authored by myself; a similar story applies both to the
    text, with much of the latest version (save the theoretical sections) being of my hand, and to
    the experiment-running (and the implied model-selection).

    \textbf{V. Sharmanska} conceived, and gave the first formulation of, the problem setting, and
    wrote significant portions of the initial versions of the paper -- those related to the
    introduction and problem setup primarily.
    %
    In later stages of the project, she took on an important advisory role and gave feedback on
    revisions of the paper.

  \item 
    %
    \textbf{N. Quadrianto} suggested the combining of distribution-matching with clustering-derived
    sample-weighting during the initial stages -- this being a major stepping stone in the
    development of the eventual support-matching method (for which said weighting was replaced by
    exact bag-based balancing) -- wrote significant portions of the original text, and ran
    experiments primarily on the clustering side.
    %
    He was also responsible for generally supervising the project, by which I mean discussing and
    advising on current progress and future avenues, and providing, inter alia, feedback on
    revisions of the paper.
