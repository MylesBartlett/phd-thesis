We have highlighted the problem that systematic bias or dataset curation can result in one or more
subgroups having zero labelled data, and by doing so, hope to have stimulated serious consideration
for it when planning, building, and evaluating %and regulating ML
%and computer vision
systems.
%
We proposed a two-step approach for addressing the resulting spurious correlations.
%
First, we construct perfect bags from an unlabelled deployment set via semisupervised clustering. 
%
Second, by matching the support of the training and deployment sets in representation space, we
learn representations with subgroup-invariance.
%
We empirically validate our frame\-work on the Coloured MNIST, CelebA and Chest-Xray8 datasets,
proving it is possible to maintain high performance on subgroups with incomplete support.
%
Furthermore, we bound the error in the objective due to imperfect clustering.
%
Future work includes exploring other unsupervised-learning methods and addressing the limitations
raised in Sec.~\ref{sec:limitations}.
