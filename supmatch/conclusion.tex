We have highlighted the problem that systematic bias or dataset curation can result in one or more
subgroups having zero labelled data, and by doing so, hope to have stimulated serious consideration
for it when planning, building, and evaluating systems.
%
We proposed a two-step approach for addressing the resulting spurious correlations.
%
First, we construct perfect bags from an unlabelled deployment set via semi-supervised clustering. 
%
Second, by matching the support of the training and deployment sets in representation space, we
learn representations with subgroup-invariance.
%
We empirically validate our frame\-work on the Coloured MNIST and CelebA datasets, showing it
possible to maintain high performance on subgroups with incomplete support.
%
Furthermore, we bound the error in the objective due to imperfect clustering.
%
Future work includes exploring other \ac{UL} methods and addressing the limitations raised in
\S\ref{sec:sm-limitations}.
