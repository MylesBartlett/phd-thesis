\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%
I would thank my family for being eternally-supportive of me and ever-tolerant of my heteroclitic
ways, to all members of PAL -- and among them most of all Thomas and Oliver, my once officemates
and hopefully-forever friends (for what tempers friendship stronger than the burning together the
midnight oil (or, more accurately, `depleting the packet of custard creams') on the eve of a
deadline), without whom I may not have made it through to where I am, or even begun the journey in
the first place -- and to my supervisor, Novi, for having faith in me when I had none in myself and
putting up with me at times when I defied understanding.
