To highlight the efficiency of Okapi, we provide estimates in Table~\ref{tab:carbon_fp} of the
carbon footprint associated with the running of it and of the ERM and FixMatch baselines on the
iWildCam dataset, using the same hyperparameter configuration used to generate the results in the
main text. The runs were conducted in a controlled fashion, using the computing infrastructure and
device count in all cases.

\begin{table}[htp]
	\centering
	\caption{
	  Comparison of the estimated carbon footprint (kgCoeq) of Okapi with the ERM and FixMatch
	  baselines per replicate of the iWildCam dataset. For the controlled training conducted to
	  enable fair computation of these estimates, we used a private infrastructure with an
	  estimated carbon efficiency of 0.432 kgCOeq/kWh and RTX 3090 GPUs, each job being run on
	  a single GPU, coupled with four data-loading workers.
